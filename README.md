# Tyr - Anthropomorphic Robotic Hand

Tyr is a 3d printed robotic hand designed to be as cheap and as anthropomorphic as possible.  It has 23 degrees of freedom, is motor-tendon driven with 19 degrees of actuation, and provides localized angular position sensing via rotational potentiometers.  Tyr is designed in Solidworks, fabricated using personal PrintrBot Jr. 3D printer, and programmed in Python using a Raspberry Pi, an ARM based mini-computer using Linux.  This repository details the capabilities, design considerations, and materials, and tools used in the manufacturing process.

Although the robotic hand project was never finished, the ultimate goal was to vastly improve my technical engineering capabilities in the field of human-like robotics and prosthetics.  As a recent Electrical Engineering graduate, this ambitious personal project took two years to research, design, fabricate, program, and document all technical aspects: mechanical, electrical, and software that goes into fabricating an inexpensive, anthropomorphic robotic hand. This also includes learning and mastering the processes and tools necessary to complete the hand and getting out of my comfort zone.  Unfortunatly, the project was abandond before all aspects were properly documented, but in the end it was a worthwhile learning experience.

## Mythos

According to Norse mythology, Loki had three horrendous and powerful children: The serpent Jormungand, the death-goddess Hel, and the wolf Fenrir.  The Aesir gods had terrible prophetic inklings that these three beings would wrought death and destruction during the events of Ragnarok, the end times.  Because of these terrible forewarnings, the gods kept these monsters restrained.

Fenrir they feared most and in order to prevent him from rampaging across the Nine Worlds, they kept the pup close in order to raise him in Asgard, city of the gods.  The only god who dared approach and feed Fenrir was Tyr, god of law and heroic glory.  The menacing wolf grew rapidly and the gods decided to restrain him out of fear.

The gods convinced the wolf to play games of strength and Fenrir eagerly accepted the challenge. Three  times the gods wrapped chains around Fenrir's neck and the wolf easily broke through the first two.  On the third attempt, however, the gods had the dwarves forge a magical chain that looked light and easily breakable.  Fenrir became suspicious of this new item and refused to be fettered unless one of the gods stuck his or her hand in his mouth as reassurance that they were not playing tricks.  Knowing full well he would lose his limb, only Tyr was brave enough to approach the wolf and place his hand in its maw.  When Fenrir was unable to break the chain, he tore the right hand off Tyr.  Fenrir was bound until the day of Ragnarok.

And thus Tyr is referred to as "Leavings of the Wolf", a poetic kenning, or figure of speech, for glory.
